| TYPE | PATTERNS |  One Liner |
| --- | --------- | ----- |
|   | [Summary](https://github.com/anshajsharma/Design-Patterns/blob/main/Types/Summary.md) | Summary of all design patterns |
| **Creational**  | [Singleton Pattern](https://github.com/anshajsharma/Design-Patterns/blob/main/Types/Creational/Singleton.md) | Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.|
|             | [Factory Method Pattern](https://github.com/anshajsharma/Design-Patterns/blob/main/Types/Creational/Factory%20Method%20Pattern.md) | Creates objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. |
|             | [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/anshajsharma/Design-Patterns/blob/main/Types/Creational/Abstract%20Factory.md) |Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. |
|             | [Builder Pattern](https://github.com/anshajsharma/Design-Patterns/blob/main/Types/Creational/Builder%20Pattern.md) | Constructs a complex object step by step. |
|             | [Prototype Pattern](https://github.com/anshajsharma/Design-Patterns/blob/main/Types/Creational/Prototype%20Pattern.md) | Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.|
| **Structural**  | [Adapter](https://github.com/anshajsharma/Design-Patterns/blob/main/Types/Structural/Adapter%20Pattern.md) | Allows incompatible interfaces to work together. |
|             | [Bridge](https://github.com/anshajsharma/Design-Patterns/blob/main/Types/Structural/Bridge%20Pattern.md) | Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation so the two can vary independently. |
|             | [Composite](https://github.com/anshajsharma/Design-Patterns/blob/main/Types/Structural/Composite%20Pattern.md) | Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. |
|             | [Decorator](https://github.com/anshajsharma/Design-Patterns/blob/main/Types/Structural/Decorator%20Pattern.md) | Adds additional behaviors to objects dynamically. |
|             | [Facade](https://github.com/anshajsharma/Design-Patterns/blob/main/Types/Structural/Facade%20Pattern.md) | Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.|
|             | [Flyweight](https://github.com/anshajsharma/Design-Patterns/blob/main/Types/Structural/Flyweight%20Pattern.md) | Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.|
|             | [Proxy](https://github.com/anshajsharma/Design-Patterns/blob/main/Types/Structural/Proxy%20Pattern.md) | Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. |
| **Behavioral**  | [Singlton]() | |
|             | [Singlton]() | |
