### Mediator Pattern Documentation

---

#### Overview

The Mediator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly and allows for more flexibility in the communication between objects. In essence, the Mediator pattern centralizes complex communication and control logic between objects into a single mediator object.

#### Key Components

1. **Mediator:** Defines an interface for communicating with colleague objects.

2. **Concrete Mediator:** Implements the Mediator interface and coordinates communication between colleague objects.

3. **Colleague:** Defines an interface for communicating with other colleagues through the mediator.

4. **Concrete Colleague:** Implements the Colleague interface and communicates with other colleagues through the mediator.

#### Example Scenario

Consider an example scenario of implementing a chat application using the Mediator pattern, where users communicate with each other through a central chat room.

##### Step 1: Implement the Mediator Interface

```java
// Mediator Interface
public interface ChatRoom {
    void sendMessage(String message, User user);
}
```

##### Step 2: Implement the Concrete Mediator

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

// Concrete Mediator
public class ChatRoomImpl implements ChatRoom {
    private List<User> users;

    public ChatRoomImpl() {
        this.users = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    @Override
    public void sendMessage(String message, User user) {
        for (User u : users) {
            if (u != user) {
                u.receiveMessage(message);
            }
        }
    }

    public void addUser(User user) {
        users.add(user);
    }
}
```

##### Step 3: Implement the Colleague Interface

```java
// Colleague Interface
public interface User {
    void sendMessage(String message);
    void receiveMessage(String message);
}
```

##### Step 4: Implement the Concrete Colleague

```java
// Concrete Colleague
public class ChatUser implements User {
    private String name;
    private ChatRoom chatRoom;

    public ChatUser(String name, ChatRoom chatRoom) {
        this.name = name;
        this.chatRoom = chatRoom;
    }

    @Override
    public void sendMessage(String message) {
        chatRoom.sendMessage(message, this);
    }

    @Override
    public void receiveMessage(String message) {
        System.out.println(name + " received message: " + message);
    }
}
```

##### Step 5: Use the Mediator in Client Code

```java
// Client Code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ChatRoom chatRoom = new ChatRoomImpl();

        User user1 = new ChatUser("Alice", chatRoom);
        User user2 = new ChatUser("Bob", chatRoom);
        User user3 = new ChatUser("Charlie", chatRoom);

        chatRoom.addUser(user1);
        chatRoom.addUser(user2);
        chatRoom.addUser(user3);

        user1.sendMessage("Hello, everyone!");
    }
}
```

#### Summary

The Mediator pattern promotes loose coupling by centralizing complex communication and control logic between objects into a single mediator object. It defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact and allows for more flexibility in the communication between objects. This pattern enhances maintainability, scalability, and flexibility by reducing direct dependencies between objects and promoting a more modular and decoupled design. The Mediator pattern is particularly useful when you have a set of objects that need to communicate with each other in a complex manner and when you want to avoid tight coupling between these objects.
