### Proxy Pattern Documentation

---

#### Overview

The Proxy pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It allows you to add a level of indirection to the original object, enabling additional functionality to be provided when accessing the object. This pattern is useful when you need to control access to an object, add extra functionality before or after the actual operation, or defer the creation of expensive objects until they are actually needed.

#### Key Components

1. **Subject:** Defines the common interface for the RealSubject and Proxy so that the Proxy can be used wherever the RealSubject is expected.

2. **RealSubject:** Represents the real object that the Proxy represents. It defines the real functionality that the Proxy controls access to.

3. **Proxy:** Provides a surrogate or placeholder for the RealSubject. It maintains a reference to the RealSubject and forwards requests to it, optionally performing additional operations before or after forwarding the request.

#### Example Scenario

Consider an example scenario of using a Proxy to control access to a sensitive database server, allowing only authorized users to access the database.

##### Step 1: Implement the Subject Interface

```java
// Subject Interface
public interface DatabaseServer {
    void queryData(String query);
}
```

##### Step 2: Implement the RealSubject

```java
// RealSubject
public class RealDatabaseServer implements DatabaseServer {
    @Override
    public void queryData(String query) {
        System.out.println("Executing query: " + query);
        // Actual database query logic
    }
}
```

##### Step 3: Implement the Proxy

```java
// Proxy
public class DatabaseServerProxy implements DatabaseServer {
    private RealDatabaseServer realServer;
    private String username;
    private String password;

    public DatabaseServerProxy(String username, String password) {
        this.username = username;
        this.password = password;
    }

    private void authenticate() {
        // Authentication logic to check username and password
    }

    @Override
    public void queryData(String query) {
        authenticate();
        if (/* check if user is authorized */) {
            realServer.queryData(query);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Unauthorized access");
        }
    }
}
```

##### Step 4: Use the Proxy in Client Code

```java
// Client Code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a proxy and access the database server
        DatabaseServer proxy = new DatabaseServerProxy("username", "password");
        proxy.queryData("SELECT * FROM users");
    }
}
```

#### Summary

The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It allows you to add a level of indirection to the original object, enabling additional functionality to be provided when accessing the object. This pattern is useful when you need to control access to an object, add extra functionality before or after the actual operation, or defer the creation of expensive objects until they are actually needed. The Proxy pattern enhances security, performance, and flexibility by providing a level of control and abstraction over the access to the real object.
