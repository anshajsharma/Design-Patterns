1. **Creational Patterns**: These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
   - **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
   - **Factory Method**: Creates objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
   - **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
   - **Builder**: Constructs a complex object step by step.
   - **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

2. **Structural Patterns**: These patterns deal with object composition, ensuring that if one part changes, the entire structure doesn’t need to change.
   - **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
   - **Bridge**: Separates an object’s interface from its implementation so the two can vary independently.
   - **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
   - **Decorator**: Adds additional behaviors to objects dynamically.
   - **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
   - **Flyweight**: Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
   - **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

3. **Behavioral Patterns**: These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
   - **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers.
   - **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object.
   - **Interpreter**: Implements a specialized language.
   - **Iterator**: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
   - **Mediator**: Reduces chaotic dependencies between objects.
   - **Memento**: Captures and restores an object’s internal state.
   - **Observer**: Allows a subject to notify observers about changes.
   - **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
   - **Strategy**: Enables selecting an algorithm’s behavior at runtime.
   - **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, with steps defined in subclasses.
   - **Visitor**: Allows adding new behaviors to classes without modifying them.
