### SOLID Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - **Definition:** A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.
   - **Purpose:** To reduce the complexity of classes by ensuring that each class handles a single functionality, making the system easier to understand and modify.
   - **Example:** If you have a `User` class that handles both user authentication and user profile management, you should split it into two classes: `UserAuthentication` and `UserProfile`.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - **Definition:** Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - **Purpose:** To allow the behavior of a system to be extended without modifying existing code, thereby reducing the risk of introducing bugs.
   - **Example:** If you need to add new types of notifications (e.g., push notifications) to an existing system, you should be able to do so by extending the existing classes rather than modifying them.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - **Definition:** Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
   - **Purpose:** To ensure that a subclass can stand in for its superclass, guaranteeing that the system behaves correctly when the subclass is used in place of the superclass.
   - **Example:** If you have a `Bird` superclass and a `Penguin` subclass, the `Penguin` class should be able to replace the `Bird` class without causing issues in the system, even if penguins cannot fly.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - **Definition:** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
   - **Purpose:** To reduce the complexity of interfaces by breaking them into smaller, more specific ones so that clients only need to know about the methods that are of interest to them.
   - **Example:** Instead of having a large `Animal` interface with methods `run()`, `fly()`, and `swim()`, you should have smaller interfaces like `Runnable`, `Flyable`, and `Swimmable` that clients can implement as needed.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - **Definition:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
   - **Purpose:** To reduce the coupling between high-level and low-level modules, making the system more flexible and easier to maintain.
   - **Example:** Instead of a `UserService` class directly instantiating a `UserRepository` class, the `UserService` should depend on an interface `IUserRepository` that the `UserRepository` implements. This allows you to change the implementation of `IUserRepository` without modifying the `UserService`.

### Summary of SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle:** One class, one responsibility.
- **Open/Closed Principle:** Open for extension, closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle:** Subclasses should be replaceable for their base classes.
- **Interface Segregation Principle:** Prefer small, client-specific interfaces over large, general-purpose ones.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle:** Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

These principles, when applied together, help create a robust, maintainable, and flexible system. Let me know if you would like examples or more detailed explanations on any of these principles!
